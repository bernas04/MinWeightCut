# Minimum Weight Cut Problem

First AA Project

Find a minimum weighted cut for a given undirected graph G(V, E), with **N** vertices and **M** edges. A minimum weighted cut of G is a partition of the graph's vertices into two complementary sets **S** and **T**, such that the sum of the weights of edges between the set **S** and the set **T** is as small as possible.




To graph be connex, it must have V-1 edges, where V represents the number of vertices.

Use 12.5%, 25%, 50% and 75% of the maximum number of edges for the number of vertices.




v*(v-1)/2 -> maximum no. of edges in graph



5(5-1)/2 = 10 -> maximum no. of edges in graph

10x0.125, 10 x 0.25, 10x0.5, 10x0.75 -> vértices
