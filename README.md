# Minimum Weight Cut Problem

First AA Project

Find a minimum weighted cut for a given undirected graph G(V, E), with **N** vertices and **M** edges. A minimum weighted cut of G is a partition of the graph's vertices into two complementary sets **S** and **T**, such that the sum of the weights of edges between the set **S** and the set **T** is as small as possible.
